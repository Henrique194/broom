Broom is a Doom source port focused on code clarity, cleanup, and maintainability. It aims to provide a modern, well-organized foundation for developers and modders by refactoring the original Doom codebase without altering its gameplay mechanics.

Broomâ€™s aims are:

 * Maintain functional parity with the original engine.
 * Improve code structure for better readability and navigation.
 * Serve as a friendly base for new developers entering the Doom engine ecosystem.

## Compatibility

Broom strives for full compatibility with Chocolate Doom, and by extension, the original Doom engine. It is intended as a drop-in replacement for projects relying on accurate vanilla behavior.
